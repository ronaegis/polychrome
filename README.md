# Polychrome

> Forked from [arfct/polychrome](https://github.com/arfct/polychrome)

Polychrome adds a sidebar with tabs and groups to the left of your browser window. 

Now that Chrome is able to unload background tabs on its own, having many, many tabs becomes worthwhile — and the tab strip is woefully unprepared.

Polychrome lets you more carefully curate, group, and archive your tabs, building a familiar structure and giving you quick access to the things you need.

## Recent Enhancements

- **Automatic Window Positioning**: Sidebar now automatically follows the active Chrome window, positioning itself at the left edge and matching the window's height
- **Instant Scrolling**: Disabled smooth scrolling for faster navigation between tabs
- **Enhanced Window Tracking**: Added listeners for window movement and resize events to maintain optimal sidebar positioning

## Usage:

1. Open chrome://extensions
2. Turn on Developer mode
3. Drag the root directory of this repository in.
4. Pin the toolbar button
5. Open it and pop out the window
